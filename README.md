Graph Theory Project

<h1>Introduction</h1>

Hello, my name is David Amankwah, and today I'll be talking about everything I worked on for my research on graph theory. I'll be discussing my knowledge and the results of the research I did. I want to make the graphy theory very easy to understand.

<h3>Graph theory</h3>

Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph is made up of vertices (also called nodes) which are connected by edges. Graph theory provides a framework for examing the properties of these graphs, such as their connectivity, distances between vertices, coloring, and many other important characteristics. Graph theory has numerous applications in fields such as computer science, operations research, physics and engineering.

<h3>Graph Isomorphism</h3>
Graph Isomorphism is a concept which refers to the process of deciding whether two graphs are isomorphic, that is, whether they have the same structure. When the graphs have the same number of vertices and edges, and the way the vertices are connected to each other is the same in both graphs, then the graphs are said to be isomorphic. The question of whether graph isomorphism can be determined in polynomial time is a major unsolved problem in computer science, known as the Graph Isomorphism problem

<h3>Graph isomorphism problem</h3>

The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. The problem is known to be in the complexity class NP (nondeterministic polynomial time). 


<h3>Graph Representations</h3>
In graph theory, a graph representation is a technique to store graph into the memory of computer.

To represent a graph, we just need the set of vertices, and for each vertex the neighbors of the vertex (vertices which is directly connected to it by an edge). I discuss two graph reprsentations in my notebook

<h2>Equipment: </h2>

<h3>Python</h3>

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of important indentation. Python is known for its clean syntax, which makes it very easy to read and write code. It also has a large standard library that allow developers to quickly and easily implement complex functionality. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. Numpy, itertools, networkx and matplotlib were libraries that i used for the graph project.

<h3>Project Jupyter</h3>

Project Jupyter is a project to develop open-source software, open standards, and services for interactive computing across multiple programming languages. Jupyter notebooks is a helpful tool to visualise data in a detailed and organised manner.

<h1> Conclusion</h1>

In conclusion, I was able to gain an understanding for the graph isomorphism problem. The research i did was beneficial. The topic was very complex and challenging. However, I was happy that is allowed me to work on my own. I tried to explain all the information on my research in depth. I tried to be very clear when explaining the information on my graph theory project. I have gained so much knowledge about researching graphs.

Python was a very simple and clear coding platform. I was happy to learning this programming lanaguage. Python was certainly a language that I used for learning about the graph isomorphism. I was able to use numpy, itertools, networkx and matplotlib library to work on the coding of the graph isomorphism problem. I checked to see if two graphs were isomorphism.

Using Jupyter notebook is the best way to explain work and code. Both can be done so efficiently with Juptyer notebook. I enjoyed the platform so much. It was very easy to understand. I was able to display all my reseach on graph theory, graph isomorphism, graph representation and the graph isomorphism problem. I can see myself using Jupyter for the future when i need to do some research.
